My name is Luana, a 27 year old girl from Brazil, who just finished her bachelor degree in Computer Science. I'm a developer, AI entusiast and currently excited about low level development, evolutionary computation and agent based modeling.

I believe that knowledge should be free and universally accessible to everyone and I hope I can teach you a little bit of what I know on this blog.

### More Information

Outside of science, I spend most of my time playing video games, watching anime, listening to music or working out.
